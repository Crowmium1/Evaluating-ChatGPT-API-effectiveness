 In helper column sort your column first and then search for unique IDs
 =IF(AND(C3<>C2, ISNUMBER(SEARCH("?.?.?.?", C3))), C3, "") unique IDs



Use formula to only highlight cells that both are duplicates and look like IP addresses
=AND(COUNTIFS(C:C, C1)>1, ISNUMBER(SEARCH("?.?.?.?", C1)))


In helper column use this for count the occurrence of each IP-like number in column A only if it's a duplicate and looks like an IP address
=IF(AND(COUNTIFS(C:C, C1)>1, ISNUMBER(SEARCH("?.?.?.?", C1))), COUNTIFS(C:C, C1), "")


Use this in helper column to tage unique and duplicate rows. These can then be sorted as a table for removal of duplicates. Best method.
=IF(COUNTIF($E$2:$E2, E2)=1, "Unique", "Duplicate")
